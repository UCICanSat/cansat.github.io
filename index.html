            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are UCI CanSat, an undergraduate project in the MAE department. Our team competes 
                in the CanSat competition, an annual, international engineering challenge to design 
                and build a space-type system. Every year the mission changes so this year's objective 
                is to build a probe that can be deployed at an altitude of around 700m, transmit telemetry 
                in real-time, and use a parachute and aerobraking heat shield to land safely at an upright 
                orientation which is signaled by a victory flag. Interested students are advised to read 
                the official mission guide for 2022-2023 here. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to meeting our competition 
                objectives, our team's goals are to provide all members with hands-on experience with 
                the process of engineering design. Over three quarters, we'll go from brainstorming and 
                concept generation, to launching our flight hardware at the competition! We are a small 
                team where everyone has a critical part to play.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Last year, UCI CanSat consisted of ten Engineering and Computer Science students led by our faculty adviser, Professor Roger Rangel. This year we plan to keep our team restricted to 10 students, the maximum allowed by competition rules.

            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="answer">CanSat holds a weekly team meeting. This will be scheduled so everyone can attend without missing class. We also schedule engineering work time in 2 or 3-hour increments. These will be separated by subsystem (Mechanical, Electrical, Embdedded Systems). Expect to attend at least 1 session per week to work on hardware or software. Youâ€™re also encouraged to work independently when no sessions are scheduled. In general, please estimate 4 hours per week, per MAE 189 unit (most students take 2 units, or put in the equivalent hours).</p>

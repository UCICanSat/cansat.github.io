                        The UCI CanSat team is a senior design project that competes in the international CanSat competition. Each year, we design, manufacture, and launch a satellite payload model according to a set of mission objectives and requirements set for that specific year. In previous years, we have designed a foldable delta-winged glider, maple seed payloads aimed at taking barometric data, and a camera payload that maintained its video orientation tethered to the container throughout the whole flight. Through these achievements, we were able to secure our second Dean’s Choice award during the 2022 Winter Design Review. We have also secured sponsorships and mentorships from large companies such as Blue Origin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team is relatively small (10 engineering members maximum) which gives each member opportunities to learn and directly contribute to our project. We spend Fall Quarter designing mechanical components in SolidWorks, selecting electrical components, and prototyping the ground station. In Winter Quarter, we manufacture mechanical prototypes, iterate on the PCB design, and begin work on programming the MCU. We also prepare for the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR). In Spring Quarter, we complete the final build and conduct tests, and we attend the CanSat competition, which usually takes place in Virginia at the end of the Quarter. 
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Work with Mechanical/Aerospace teammates to design, fabricate, assemble, and test the mechanical structure, mechanisms, and descent control devices of the CanSat. Fall Quarter is focused on creating the mechanical design in Solidworks. Most work is done individually in Solidworks with weekly mechanical subteam meetings. Winter Quarter is focused on 3D printing and manufacturing the CanSat, as well as testing the mechanisms. Team members attend scheduled lab times to start prints and test and assemble prototypes. Spring Quarter is devoted to design iteration and testing, as well as finalizing the CanSat for the competition. Most of the time is spent working on assembly and testing in the lab. Environmental tests including a vacuum test, thermal test, vibration test, and drop test are performed.                    </p>

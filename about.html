                <p>
                    We are UCI CanSat, a vibrant and enthusiastic student engineering team from
                    the University of California, Irvine (UCI). Our team is composed of a diverse
                    blend of passionate students unified under one mission: to excel in the
                    International CanSat competition. This annual student design-build-launch
                    event, spearheaded by the American Astronautical Society (AAS), provides an
                    opportunity for us to experience the entire development cycle of a complex
                    engineering project – from conceptual design through integration and testing, to
                    real-world operation and post-mission summary. Last year, we placed 14th in
                    the World, and 5th in the United States out of over 100 particpating teams.

                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>
                    The UCI CanSat team is a prominent representation of the University of
                    California, Irvine's commitment to pushing the boundaries of student-led
                    engineering projects. Comprised of a dedicated and dynamic group of
                    students, the team participates in the CanSat competition to hone their
                    engineering skills. The competition not only offers an avenue to apply
                    theoretical knowledge but also propels UCI's engineering students into real-
                    world scenarios that mimic the challenges faced by professionals in the
                    industry.

                        <p>
                            UCI AntSat was founded in 2017 by a group of undergraduate students at UC Irvine
                            with the mission to compete in the American Astronautical Society International
                            CanSat Competition.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Founded in the 2017-2018 academic year,
                        UCI CanSat is a specialized undergraduate
                        project within the Mechanical and Aerospace
                        Engineering (MAE) department at the
                        University of California, Irvine. We participate
                        in the annual CanSat competition, a global
                        engineering challenge to design, build, and
                        launch a space-type system. Each year
                        brings a new mission; for 2022-2023, our
                        focus is to create a probe that will be
                        deployed at an altitude of approximately
                        700m, transmit real-time telemetry and
                        execute a controlled landing using a
                        parachute and aerobraking heat shield.
                        Beyond competition goals, we aim to furnish
                        our members with practical engineering skills.
                        Over the course of three academic quarters,
                        our team transitioned from brainstorming to
                        actual launch, offering hands-on experience
                        in engineering design. Last year, under the
                        guidance of our faculty adviser, Professor
                        Roger Rangel, our team of 10 students
                        placed 14th in the world.

                <h2>COMPETITION TIMELINE</h2>
                <p>
                    In a span of one year, our team will
                    advance through several key phases to
                    ensure the success of our CanSat
                    project. Our journey begins with
                    meticulous 'Planning,
                    ' where we establish
                    objectives, allocate resources, and set
                    deadlines. This is followed by the
                    'Prototype' phase, in which initial designs
                    are created and evaluated.
                    'Preliminary
                    Design Review (PDR)' and 'Critical
                    Design Review (CDR)' are the next
                    crucial steps, providing in-depth analyses
                    and adjustments to our design.
                    Subsequent to these reviews, we move
                    to 'Testing,
                    ' rigorously examining the
                    CanSat under simulated conditions.
                    Finally, all systems are 'Go' for the
                    'Launch,
                    ' the crowning event that
                    validates our year-long efforts. We will
                    travel to Virginia to compete against
                    teams around the world, trying to
                    determine which CanSat design performs
                    the best.
